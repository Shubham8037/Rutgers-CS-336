   * In a detailed email to Jeemisaba Chudasama and the Professor, Sindhu Adem and Mehali Hathi have explained the issues with the group participation and the reason why the project wasn’t able to be done entirely. 
      * Mehali Hathi and Sindhu Adem were supposed to work on the customer functionalities while the other three group members worked on the admin and customer rep functionalities, however the three group members never even began their part of the project. With the extension Sindhu Adem and Mehali Hathi have gone forward and completed as much of the admin and customer rep functionalities as possible.
